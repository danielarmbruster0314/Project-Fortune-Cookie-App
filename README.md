# Project-Fortune-Cookie-App


# Pitch 
    Have you ever wanted to gain insight and direction from the universe at large as to what your soul purpose is on this planet....? Me too and unfortunatly this app doesnt do that however it can provide you with a nugget of wisdom or offer you the opportunity to potentaily give someone else a nugget of wisdom with this fun fortune cookie app.

--***IMPORTANT*** note that before using the app you must first start a node in your terminal for the db.json server before utilizing the app otherwise it will not function properly--
                                        set up node by using the command " json-server --watch db.json " in your terminal


    This project is an appliaction that displays a fortune cookie with a list of options. The options refer to the available user input and user interactivity that can be had with this application. The user can either generate a regular fortune by clicking the *Regular Fortune button* which will play a css animation that breaks open the fortune cookie and provides a random proverb response with its own set of corresponding lucky numbers provided from the local server API. It can also generate just the proverb by selecting the *Just The Wisdom button*  or just the numbers by selecting the *Just The Lottery button*. The last feature is to create a proverb by submiting text in the provided text imput where the users input will add their provided proverb to the local node API and become one of the possible outcomes.
    
    If the user has generated a fortune by clicking one of the buttons they will have to click one of the buttons again before recieving a fortune in order to reset the cookie.


--please enjoy!
